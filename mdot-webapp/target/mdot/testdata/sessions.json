      "description":"The age of the 'one size fits all' Internet is long behind us. Our digital lives and experiences -- at IU and elsewhere -- are individually tailored based on preferences, trends, and other data about us. What's more, access to services, features, opportunities, and more are, these days, largely based on our roles, our identities -- in essence -- our digital selves.<br/><br/>In most cases, it's as simple as typing a password, swiping a card, or turning a key. But we have multiple keys, various passwords, and different cards -- all corresponding to various roles in life.<br/><br/>Join representatives from UITS' Identity Management Systems group and the University Information Security Office for a lighthearted, entertaining but informative exploration of issues like: how all this affects our digital lives, what's really going on under the hood, how all this customization occurs, and most importantly, where it's all going and the sorts of personal and organizational privacy- and security-related caveats for which you should be watching out.<br/><br/>Arthur C. Clarke states that: 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' This session asserts that, as we login to the future, knowing the mechanics of 'getting carded on the Net' makes it no less mystical.",

How might the IU teaching centers facilitate and support an investigation into the effective use of iPads in the classroom?<br/><br/>During the 2010-11 academic year, three Faculty Learning Communities (FLC) at IUB and IUPUI were created to study and document the use of a set of iPads during class sessions. The FLCs were composed of 8 faculty members who meet very two to three weeks to work in a collaborative community exploring the use of iPads and to share their findings. Each member was provided with an iPad, a stipend for purchasing apps and other research purposes, and access to a kit of 25 iPads.<br/><br/>The teaching centers facilitated the meetings and maintained the iPads. The presenters will describe the process of purchasing apps for the student iPads, synching 25 iPads to one iTunes account, and the logistics of scheduling the checkout of the classroom set. We will also highlight some of the findings of the iPad FLC and directions for this year.<br /><br /><strong>Resources</strong><ul> <li><a href=&quot;http://citl.indiana.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>IUB Center for Innovative Teaching and Learning</a></li> <li><a href=&quot;http://ctl.iupui.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>IUPUI Center for Teaching and Learning</a></li> <li><a href=&quot;http://images.apple.com/education/docs/20110727_IOS_4_Education_Deployment_Guide.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Apple iOS 4 Education Deployment Guide</a></li></ul>",

In addition to content from the KMS repository, the tool could deliver content from other repositories. The content could be text, or multimedia content, making it possible to offer how-to steps, screen-casts, videos, or links to resources (system notices, training offerings, request forms, etc.). The model can be extended for use beyond Kuali applications, to any web based application used by an institution. The session will be part presentation and demonstration, with audience interaction and discussion encouraged.

A total of 31 unique users who were representative of the site's audience &emdash; IU students, faculty, staff, as well as community users not affiliated with IU &emdash; participated in the studies.<br/><br/>During the presentation, members from each team will present the project from their unique perspective, focusing on what was learned from usability testing and user feedback and how that was reflected on the next iteration of redesign. Video clips from the usability testing sessions will also be presented.<br/><br/>This is a unique case study that exemplifies IU's Strategic Plan for IT in action.. Recommendation 8 of the Empowering People states:<br/><br/>Indiana University should implement a variety of approaches to IT education, skills acquisition, support, and communication that enable any willing learner to efficiently acquire desired IT skills.<br/><br/>The services provided by the IT Training team, and by extension its website, is a crucial component in supporting this key recommendation.

      "description":"The IUPUI Center for Teaching and Learning has received grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Next Generation Learning Challenges (NGLC) to explore the viability of offering online,  Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) sessions done in Introductory Chemistry.  These sessions are normally done in a face-to-face format in a classroom setting.PLTL is a model of teaching that preserves the lecture and replaces recitation in science courses with a weekly two-hour session. During these interactive sessions (workshops), six to eight students work as a team to solve carefully constructed problems under the guidance of a peer leader. <br/><br/>This session will describe how Adobe Connect makes it possible to adapt this face-to-face pedagogy to a synchronous online environment that we are calling cyber Peer-Led Team Learning (cPLTL).  During the session, we will also describe the technology roadblocks and glitches that were experienced along the way as well as the changes that will be implemented for the fall semester to address some of these initial problems. We will also highlight some of the early feedback that we have received from the students and Peer Leaders from the first semester of using this format.<br /><br />Extending the learning experience beyond the physical classroom is a promise of pervasive technologies, but logistics and overall time constraints often limit such possibilities in face-to-face courses. Still, evidence suggests that experiential learning is a key ingredient in educating the twenty-first century student; therefore, seeking out learning opportunities beyond the traditional class meeting time should be considered in the most effective technology-enhanced pedagogy. Through use of the Oncourse Blog tool, students in an IUPUI undergraduate American Studies course took a semester-long virtual road trip across the United States. Along with other assignments, students utilized the Blog tool as a way of recording their own experiences, and responding to those of their classmates. This presentation will explore these virtual road trips and argue that, through the use of the Blog tool, students achieved a richer understanding of the course material versus traditional lecture format.

Services are thus campus restricted, and security perimeters are erected, for instance via unique university network ID's, firewalls, etc.  Collaboration technologies in this &quot;local&quot; space have for some time been enabling students and research teams to collaborate and share IT resources with others on the campus.  However, funding agencies are increasingly stressing, and in some cases even requiring, collaborative research and data sharing. PIs must bring together people from across the state, country, or the world, often within days, even hours. They want to be able to create shared workspaces for team members, (a) without regard to user location, (b) right now, and (c) without interference from campus IT bureaucracy.

      "description":"Every student in today's academic environment needs training to keep up with the fast changing world of technology. More and more often, changes in technology are occurring faster than training solutions can be developed and provided. The world is quickly moving from a desktop environment to a mobile environment.<br /><br />Gone are the days where students focused solely on a textbook and lectures and then used paper and pencil, markers and crayons, tape, glue sticks and typewriters to create their assignments and papers. Today, students find themselves in a classroom environment that relies heavily on technology. Online course management systems, digital textbooks, research papers, multimedia presentations, podcasts and vodcasts, online collaboration and messaging, laptop computers, and mobile devices now comprise the majority of a student's toolset. Many campuses are offering totally online courses that rely exclusively on technology; these students may not have local technical support. Pressure is building to move these activities to a mobile environment. In reality, it is a preparation for the future!<br /><br />Many students are not engaged enough with technology to keep up. Some find themselves behind before they even start a course. We see others who are creating homework assignments by the &quot;old methods.&quot; Other students find a way to get the job done with computer tools but evidence shows that their documents may be more &quot;hacked&quot; together rather than having been created correctly. When students are equipped with the proper skills, the task of preparing a professional-looking electronic assignment is much easier.<br /><br />IT Training at IU Kokomo has identified three major issues that apply directly to the success of our training mission: We remove technology road blocks to enable student success!<br /><br/>1. What technology training &quot;topics&quot; are important to students?<br />2. What delivery &quot;channel&quot; do students prefer to receive their training?<br />3. What delivery &quot;format&quot; is most effective for training?<br /><br/>Through a new training process model, IT Training at IU Kokomo is aggressively attacking these issues because we believe they are important for the delivery of training solutions at the college level. We are encouraging students, and also faculty and staff, to take advantage of our training opportunities. The current options available are instructor-led training sessions, one-on-one tutoring sessions, faculty-requested classroom training, online tutorials, and Lynda.com. We are considering online multimedia tutorials in the future. To be proactive, we recognize that we must remain flexible to develop new delivery methods and topics. As a result, we are seeing growth in the number of students taking advantage of our training and their satisfaction with our processes. <br /><br />IT Training at IU Kokomo Is On The Move to Drive Student Success!<br />",

However, to achieve this users must understand and be able to deploy the records management functionality built into SharePoint.   This session will review and demonstrate the essential features of Sharepoint's suite of tools that allow users to archive documents and then to manage them over the long-term.  More specifically the presenters will examine the following topics:  1) Declaring documents as records that need to be retained and moving them to the secure records center; 2) Assigning descriptive metadata to the documents so that they can be easily accessed; and 3) Managing the process of automatically assigning retention and disposal values to records, so that documents with long-term value are preserved and those records with short-term value are destroyed at the appropriate time.",

      "description":"Variations is a digital music library system developed and supported at IU in a partnership between the Digital Library Program (jointly supported by the Libraries and UITS), Cook Music Library, and the Jacobs School of Music over the course of the past fifteen years. The current implementation, put into production in 2005, used a desktop Java client for Windows and Mac, relying on QuickTime for Java for audio streaming and DjVu for score page presentation. In addition to media presentation, Variations also includes teaching and learning tools, as well as methods for authorization and authentication.<br/><br/>Although the desktop client is still in heavy use, the changing needs of our users prompted the Variations team to develop and deliver a web-based client for audio listening, and, in the spring of this year, a pilot iOS app for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch users.  The pilot app focused on delivering a tool for audio listening, with other features to be phased in in the future.<br/><br/>In this talk, we will discuss the evolution and challenges of this pilot development, including the choice of a native iOS app versus a web app (or a different mobile platform), the specific challenges to mobile audio delivery, and how our past technology choices influenced decisions. We will also discuss the future plans for this project in the context of our users’ needs, technology and resource constraints, and the direction of mobile development, both at large and here at IU.",

REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a simple, flexible tool for inexpensively building secure, web-based data capture systems. It was originally designed for supporting clinical research, but is general enough to help in many areas. With REDCap you can quickly create a reliable data entry and reporting system, either for use by internal staff or as a survey to be distributed to a particular community or the entire public, without doing any programming. Data entry forms and reports are built dynamically from a readily-understood metadata format, which can be created through either a graphical or spreadsheet interface. REDCap also provides a variety of other features including double-data entry, branching logic, detailed logging, hiding protected identifiers, graphical statistics, and more. <br/><br/>REDCap was developed by and is actively maintained by Vanderbilt University (http://www.project-redcap.org). It is in use by more than two hundred institutions worldwide, including the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (Indiana CTSI), which makes REDCap available to all partner institutions. Within the Indiana CTSI, REDCap has more than 230 active users working in more than sixty active projects, primarily on the IUPUI campus. REDCap is available for little or no cost to all Indiana University faculty and staff and is an excellent tool for leveraging shared resources for increased efficiency.",

      "description":"<p>Today's young people are growing up in a very different ecology of culture and knowledge than that experienced by earlier generations. The Internet, digital media production tools, portable media, and immersive social gaming environments are part of broad-based shifts in how we express ourselves, produce and access knowledge, and connect with others. This new media ecology can be a powerful driver of meaningful, demand-driven, and socially connected learning, but in our research, we found that very few young people, parents, and educators were taking advantage of this potential. Really tapping into the learning potential of today's new media environment requires building more robust connections between formal and informal learning environments, and across social, recreational, and academic activities. This talk will describe what our research has taught us about the broad shifts in how young people are learning and engaging with new media, and suggest areas of opportunity for supporting learning keyed to a networked age.</p>",
