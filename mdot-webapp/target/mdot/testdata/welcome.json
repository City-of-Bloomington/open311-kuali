      "welcome":"<h4>Dear IT Colleagues,</h4><p><img alt='Brad Wheeler, Vice President for Information Technology and CIO' width='100' height='137' src='http://statewideit.iu.edu/files/images/BradWheeler.png' align='right' border='0'> I hope to see you at IU Bloomington for this year's Statewide IT Conference on 29-30 September. The conference is jam-packed with insights on IT advancements for IU students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Our theme is &quot;My Digital Life @ IU,&quot; and all campuses will have opportunities to illustrate how technology is shaping learning, research, work, and social lives at IU.</p><p>Pre-conference IT training will be available on September 28, and then I'll kick off the conference with opening remarks, again in the theater-in-the- round format, in Alumni Hall at the Indiana Memorial Union. We'll delve into issues of privacy and online contracts, then your colleagues will share first hand experiences in over 30 in-depth sessions touching on topics such as Citrix, mobility services, SharePoint, Unified Communications with Lync, telepresence, Talisma CRM, all things Kuali, what's next with Oncourse, and much more.</p><p>Thursday evening, we'll have a special reception and staff recognition event in the new Cyberinfrastructure Building (CIB). This will be a great time to meet peers and expand your professional network before heading out to dinner.</p><p>Friday morning will open with Brian McDonald who has led IU's highly successful engagement in the MOR Associates IT Leadership Development Program. As our staff graduates know, Brian is full of highly entertaining but cutting insights into the behaviors of effective leadership. We'll follow with more breakout sessions then conclude with the insightful Mimi Ito, a cultural anthropologist studying new media use, particularly among youth in Japan and the US.</p><p>Following the last session, the IU Cinema has graciously agreed to screen a re-mastered version of &quot;Hoosiers&quot; and some IU student 3D films for us. The Cinema is truly a state-of-the art facility with 2K and 4K digital projectors, precision film projectors, and THX sound certification. We have also arranged for discounted football tickets to the IU vs. Penn State game on Saturday, and we will host a tailgate cookout before the game.</p><p>This is the first Statewide IT Conference that will welcome IT staff from our regional campuses as our UITS colleagues, and it is another opportunity to strengthen our relationships with the many IT professionals in schools, administrative departments, and research projects. My Digital Life @ IU is an evolving tale, and we'll look forward to your role at this year's conference.</p><img alt='Brad Wheeler' class='Signature' width='200' height='48' src='http://statewideit.iu.edu/files/images/BradWheeler-Signature.png' border='0'><p>--Brad<br />------------------------<br />IU Vice President for IT &amp; CIO, Dean, and Professor<br>Indiana University, http://ovpit.iu.edu</p>"
