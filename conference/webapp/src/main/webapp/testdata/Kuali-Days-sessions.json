It will provide insight into the evaluation process, which methods and tools were used to communicate, how UConn quantified the evaluation, and ultimately what sold its senior management team on KFS. \r\nMoreover, UConn will share details of its experience in both evaluating KFS and also how it convinced key decision makers to approve KFS as the replacement of its legacy system, Financial Records System (FRS). UConn spent about one and one-half years using a proof of concept, developing hands-on sessions, and communicating to various constituencies on its campus before presenting KFS as its financial system of choice to its senior management team. Consensus was achieved by including not only central administrative staff but also by engaging academic departments, student affairs, and athletics. Staff from all of these areas also attended a two-day intensive site visit of KFS at Colorado State University, a school that was previously an FRS school. \r\nFrom this session your school will gain valuable information on how to persuade your university to choose KFS, joining this sustainable and evolving open source community.\r\n\r\nA Day in the Life of a Typical KFS User\r\n\r\nThis session will give attendees a glimpse of how the KFS eDocs are used to accomplish some of the most common day-to-day financial transactions. A great compliment to the individual module sessions. In My Life will take attendees through several scenarios from start (which eDoc to use) to finish (final approval of the document).\r\n\r\n"

We anticipate a lively discussion on approaches and expected outcomes.\r\n\r\nCreating Community Across Projects and Partners: The Kuali OLE Story\r\n\r\nLibraries rely on enterprise-level software to manage and provide access to items in their collections. They track interrelated transactions that range from ordering and paying for these items to loaning them to library patrons--a complex and costly undertaking. \r\n\r\nThe prevailing model of integrated library systems (ILS), offered by commercial vendors,  tracks physical books and other traditional formats such as journals and films. increasingly resources are electronic and diverse while users may be mobile and remote, in need of accessing information in new ways. Kuali OLE (Open Library Environment) is designed to scale up to connect with other enterprise technology systems within the academic and administrative computing environment. \r\n\r\nThe Kuali OLE  project is developing a community-source library management system  that is based on a re-examined model of library business operations.  It is designed to address current needs, identified and solved by the very people who daily use the systems.Further, the project establishes a  governance model in which the entire community can collaborate to own and govern the resulting intellectual property.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In addition, workflow allows approvals to be obtained then user access grants committed eliminating the need for manual security maintenance by central staff.  KSR will help institutions minimize the maintenance costs of on-going access changes by automating the request, approval and grant processes.   This session will be a demonstration of KSR.

Business drivers behind this movement include audit findings that concluded that there was too many staff with the ability to affect HR records, a need to improve data consistency in the ERP systems to improve decision-making, and a desire to move to consolidated processing models for streamlining and simplification of business processes. Technical drivers included a need to lower the total cost of ownership of the ERP systems. Starting with the Financial Systems, compartmentalizing the system usage to fewer, more highly trained users in service centers will allow a move to more delivered installation of the system, lowering the cost of ownership significantly over time, and allowing the adoption of new functionality in a more flexible timeline. \r\nThe new request and approval systems created are simple to create and deploy and no longer put the majority of the user population in the path of upgrade cycles.\r\nWe'll also discuss at a high level the technology Ohio State has deployed to make this work. Using java and deploying some open source components of the Kuali foundation's RICE product, a lightweight, open source and simple platform was developed, called Buckeye OASIS.  In addition to Kuali Enterprise Workflow, the platform consists of the Jboss Seam web framework and Apache CXF web services, both highly regarded open source projects. Rice is deployed as a standalone server, and the Seam web applications use the Thin Client to integrate with the workflow engine. PeopleSoft data is accessed via CXF web services. All of the Oasis applications have a common look-and-feel and make extensive use of Ajax to provide an enhanced user experience. This interface was created with the use of the library of UI components available from the Seam community.  "

Library staff who participate in software selection, implementation, and maintenance should understand what the Kuali Foundation and Kuali OLE can offer their institution and be able to determine if OLE is an appropriate solution for their library.  In this session, experts from three different libraries will discuss the case for implementing Kuali OLE and will provide an overview of the current range of functionalities and address common misconceptions often associated with library systems software. We will review the selection process and will conclude by describing requirements for a successful deployment. By focusing on the evaluative, financial, and organizational aspects of selecting, implementing, and sustaining an open source system, we hope to communicate how to compare and contrast Kuali OLE and its development environment with other library management systems.\r\n\r\nKuali OLE Project Update\r\n\r\nKuali OLE intends to deliver nothing less than an enterprise-ready, community source software package for academic and research libraries and a governance model in which the entire library community can collaborate to own and govern the resulting intellectual property. Kuali OLE began development in February of 2011 and is progressing rapidly towards its version 1 release in July of 2012.  This presentation will highlight key milestones in the project, in addition to current and future roadmaps, governance and resource models, key technology decisions, and an overview of the project?s funding.\r\n\r\n"

The doc store is the repository of record for all resources managed by the OLE system.  The primary function of a doc store is to support heterogeneous documents in their native format and to support customization, scalability and agility. The doc store architecture provides the flexibility to add new document types with minimal configuration to indexes for search & retrieval for a variety of document types.\r\n\r\nThe doc store will provide a unified repository to support ingest, storage, and retrieval for individual library bibliographic records. Content ingestion and creation encompasses the activities around importing, authoring, editing and committing new and existing records. Content includes several industry standard formats. This process will integrate closely with OLE workflow to support editing for metadata creation. \r\n\r\nHigh Level Architecture\r\nDoc store architecture leverages two major industry standard components, Jackrabbit for document storage and SOLR/Lucene for indexing and searching. This architecture is designed to scale to tens of millions of documents on commodity hardware. \r\n\r\nIndex Configuration\r\nSystem will provide default index configuration for standard document types such as MARC, Dublin Core, ONYX, etc., though, implementing organizations can easily add new document types, configure indexes for new document types and modify index configurations for existing document types.  Application specialists and staff users can configure the indexes, search fields, sort fields, default sort orders in XML configuration files.\r\n\r\nDoc Storage Configuration\r\nThe OLE Document store can be configured to support new document types, logical structuring of document types and linking of document types within the OLE application layer.\r\nContent Ingestion & Loading\r\nContent can be loaded from FTP, File System HTTP Service. One time bulk load is recommended from file system. Content is validated and verified before loading into the repository. Rules for content loading are applied to the content to de-dupe and overlay the documents. Based on the confidence level in matching the documents, the doc store can automatically de-dupe or overlay the content or route it through OLE workflow for approval.\r\n\r\nThe System Demo will cover the following tasks:\r\nIndex Configuration\r\nDocument Store Configuration\r\nDiscovery (Search, Browse, Faceted Navigation)\r\nDocument Retrieve\r\nDocument Management (Check-out, Edit, Check-in, Version)\r\nBib-Editors\r\nIngestion & Indexing (matching, de-duping, overlaying)\r\nDocument store would provide flexibility to add new document types with minimal configuration, index, and search & retrieve new document types.\r\n\r\nNote: This session will be repeated on Wednesday.

Human resource and payroll management in higher education environments have typically relied on home grown systems or commercial systems that have been modified and customized to address the needs of higher education. In the discussion of the Big Picture and the modules that make up the Big Picture we will offer definitions of the modules and proposed timelines. We will also receive thoughts and input on our direction.  We will talk about our aspirations for a comprehensive, open source system and discuss the opportunities you and your institution to influence the design of each module based on your own needs and experiences.  \r\n\r\nKuali People Management for the Enterprise was launched in November 2010, and in 2011 at least three institutions will be implementing Timekeeping and Leave Management. The next modules for development in this comprehensive human resource payroll system are Position Management and HR Core Transactions, which include on-boarding and identity management.\r\n\r\nAn organization?s people represent 65% to 80% of the organization?s budget.  The best administrative tools are necessary for integrated and consistent tools to manage people.  People management involves management of their positions, their pay, their leave, and the payroll.  It involves informed and timely decision-making that is supported by accurate, up-to-the minute data.  It involves the most effective and efficient use of data and service-centered systems, and it involves compliance with relevant rules and regulations. \r\n\r\nTherefore, to satisfy the need, KPME must be comprehensive.  The functionality built into each module must be agile to accommodate different and changing needs within an organization and to accommodate integration with other modules.  Furthermore, the data models of each module must complement the business models of the organization.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, KPME and the various modules that make up KPME are available on open source platform making it available to anyone with no licensing and no annual maintenance fees.\r\n\r\n"

            "details":"Doc Store Overview\r\nA critical component of the Kuali OLE system is its document store.  The doc store is the repository of record for all resources managed by the OLE system.  The primary function of a doc store is to support heterogeneous documents in their native format and to support customization, scalability and agility. The doc store architecture provides the flexibility to add new document types with minimal configuration to indexes for search & retrieval for a variety of document types.\r\n\r\nThe doc store will provide a unified repository to support ingest, storage, and retrieval for individual library bibliographic records. Content ingestion and creation encompasses the activities around importing, authoring, editing and committing new and existing records. Content includes several industry standard formats. This process will integrate closely with OLE workflow to support editing for metadata creation. \r\n\r\nHigh Level Architecture\r\nDoc store architecture leverages two major industry standard components, Jackrabbit for document storage and SOLR/Lucene for indexing and searching. This architecture is designed to scale to tens of millions of documents on commodity hardware. \r\n\r\nIndex Configuration\r\nSystem will provide default index configuration for standard document types such as MARC, Dublin Core, ONYX, etc., though, implementing organizations can easily add new document types, configure indexes for new document types and modify index configurations for existing document types.  Application specialists and staff users can configure the indexes, search fields, sort fields, default sort orders in XML configuration files.\r\n\r\nDoc Storage Configuration\r\nThe OLE Document store can be configured to support new document types, logical structuring of document types and linking of document types within the OLE application layer.\r\nContent Ingestion & Loading\r\nContent can be loaded from FTP, File System HTTP Service. One time bulk load is recommended from file system. Content is validated and verified before loading into the repository. Rules for content loading are applied to the content to de-dupe and overlay the documents. Based on the confidence level in matching the documents, the doc store can automatically de-dupe or overlay the content or route it through OLE workflow for approval.\r\n\r\nThe System Demo will cover the following tasks:\r\nIndex Configuration\r\nDocument Store Configuration\r\nDiscovery (Search, Browse, Faceted Navigation)\r\nDocument Retrieve\r\nDocument Management (Check-out, Edit, Check-in, Version)\r\nBib-Editors\r\nIngestion & Indexing (matching, de-duping, overlaying)\r\nDocument store would provide flexibility to add new document types with minimal configuration, index, and search & retrieve new document types."

Many institutions have spent considerable resources modifying commercial HR packages or developing homegrown systems in order to satisfy requirements related to managing positions, employee job actions, benefits, and payroll. Kuali People Management for the Enterprise (KPME) will provide an alternative for institutions by delivering functionality based on a sustainable model of software developed by higher education for higher education. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy the diversity of needs within higher education, KPME must be comprehensive.  The functionality built into each module must be agile to accommodate different and changing needs within an organization and to accommodate integration with other modules.  Furthermore, the data models of each module must complement the business models of the organization.\r\n\r\nKuali People Management for the Enterprise will be a robust system flexible enough to accommodate the range of policies and practices employed at a diverse set of institutions. Some examples of the variety of requirements seen from institutions include:\r\n\r\nLeave Management \r\n?\tAutomatic payout of unspent leave\r\n?\tCarry-forward of unused holidays\r\n?\tLeave taken in day increments rather than hours\r\n?\tUnique formulas for calculation of partial leave accrual\r\n\r\nPosition Management\r\n?\tSingle or multiple concurrent jobs within a position\r\n?\tPay-base driven classification codes and titles \r\n?\tHead count tracking by position\r\n\r\nRole Management and Affiliation\r\n?\tEmployees with multiple affiliations (eg. rank faculty in one or more units, administrator in another unit)\r\n?\tOversees faculty included as instructors for course offerings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this roundtable discussion we will review the current capabilities planned for the Leave Management, Position Management, and HR Core Transactions modules and solicit input about additional functionality that is desired. You can help shape this Kuali project by sharing your vision for what an ideal HR and Payroll system would provide. \r\n"
